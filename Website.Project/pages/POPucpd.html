		<p>Its citizens consist of men, women, aliens, freaks, vampires, mutants, monsters, myths, werewolves and the most deadly creature on the face of the earth, Politicians. <br><br>

		Imagine the Tower of Babel buried under a  mile of earth, filled with every type of character possible, all the while sitting on a fusion bomb as delicate as an egg.<br><br>

		History
		The world that is Utopia City, was established in the early 60's by a small cabal of independents in the US intelligence community who saw a need for such a place. At the head of this group was the man known only as Victor.<br><br>
	
		Victor saw the growing need for a place where the myths, legends and monsters of lore could live. He saw the increasing number of encounters that humanity was having with the darker corners of the world.  His plan was to offer a haven for those that wanted to live as normal a life as possible, and in 1971 Utopia City broke ground.<br><br>

		<h3>Grey</h3>

		<div class="charbox"> 
			<div class="charimage">
			<img src="../images/Grey1.jpg"></div>
			<div class="chartext">
			<p>Grey is the Master Smith of Utopia City filling the scientific and technological void left by the City's founder, Victor.</p>

			<p>Born Justin Christopher Grey, and raised in one of Brooklyn's hardest neighborhoods; Bed Stuy (do or die), Grey showed a more than  amazing ability to manipulate machines (cars, guns, radios, etc.), and the newest craze, computer hacking. Having developed a reputation as a freak super fix-it man, Grey caught the attention of one of Victor’s newly established contact team. Finding life as just a fixer boring, Grey accepts citizenship and moves to Utopia City.</p>
		
			<p>As Master Smith of Utopia City, Grey had improved the quality/standard of living to such a degree that  its citizens lived an almost utopian lifestyle. With the fall of the other cities, Utopia City has had to absorb four times its recommended population, causing  a severe strain on the city's day to day wear and tear. As a result Grey has had to resume his role as the super fix it man, struggling to keep the city going on both a physically and emotional level. </p>
		
			<p>Grey has the body of a six foot man squashed down to just five feet, as a result of this mutation, Grey can lift up to 15 tons, can take a small arms burst at close range, and has an almost limitless intellect. </p>
		
			<p>Grey's greatest tools after his brain are his Multi-hammer and his House computer. </p>

			<p>Multi-hammer - If Grey's greatest tool is his mind, then his second greatest tool is his Multi-hammer. The Multi-hammer is one of the greatest scientific inventions of all time. It’s a tricorder, phaser, power tap, and dimensional anchor all rolled up into one very hard looking and fully functional hammer. </p>
		
			<p>The following is a list of the hammers main capabilities, but the hammer is not limited to just these items (but the story must allow for him to make adjustments to the hammer, no Batman like magic switch and instant super weapon. Also there should be some real life physics involved).</p>
				<ul>
				<li>analyzer</li>
				<li>force beam</li>
				<li>photon accelerator</li>
				<li>solid light shield</li>
				<li>stasis beam/stunner</li>
				<li>sensor</li>
				<li>holographic interface/projector</li></ul>
		
			<p>The hammer is also Grey's' link to his Home bases Super-computer. This link uses a subspace signal that allows a faster than light transmission. With the link he can use the hammer to send  information back to his base computer for any analysis that is beyond the hammers capabilities. </p>
		
			<p>The hammer can also be used as a key for the Subspace Multi-Lab.  Similar to its com-link, the hammer is programmed to resonate a subspace signal that will act as a lifeline that can either bring him to the Multi-Lab or to the Anchor Point in the real world.

		<h3>Janus</h3>

		

		<div class="charbox"> 
			<div class="charimage">
			<img src="../images/Crazy.Red.png"></div>
			<div class="chartext">
			<p>
			Janus is one of the Gorgons of legend, she is the sole survivor of Perseus’s attack. Learning to control  her power, Janus became good friends with Victor in the late 1800's. Upon completion of Utopia City, Janus became its first Citizen, and later its Chief of Police. </p>
		
			<p>Janus, by nature is a very structured person, with a keen sense of group dynamics and how to best utilize a person’s talents. She will delegate cases to subordinates, but will on occasion take a personal interest in a case. With the great collapse, new demands are being placed on the City, she was able to restructure the UCPD into a police force that doesn't just enforce the peace but makes it.</p> 	
		
			<p>Having full control of her gift, Janus has found that she can temporarily (or permanently) transform objects or life forms into a granite like substance that is as flexible as flesh. While under this transformation people are subject to her will (strong willed people can fight her control but are still transformed into stone.) Her power is not without its cost, to make a permanent change requires her to expend energy, but temporary changes require energy and concentration.

		<h3>Noli</h3>

		<div class="charbox"> 
			<div class="charimage">
			<img src="../images/Noli.png"></div>
			<div class="chartext">
			<p>
			Known as the warrior/hunter, Noli is the best detective in the UCPD. Noli has a very good working relationship with both Grey and Chief Janus. Due to his imposing figure few test his physical ability and skill, and those that try learn their error very quickly. He is a master of both armed and unarmed combat, has the strength of five men, can sustain a steady pace of 70 mph for twenty minutes, and his senses are as acute as a tiger.  The one mystery that still eludes him is the mystery of his past, when he came to Utopia City he suffered from (and still does) amnesia. Fortunately he still possess his technical skills and knowledge.
