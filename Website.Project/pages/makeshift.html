		<h3>Introduction</h3>

		<p>MakeShift is the super heroic story of a young man, trying to make his mark on the world. Fast paced and full of action, MakeShift is full of references from 70's, 80's, and 90's Sci-fi. In short, it is the ultimate Fanboy Book.</p>  

		<h3>Pedro Hernandez/Makeshift </h3>

			<p>Makeshift's origins and powers are unique in that he is not a clone or a mutant, but a genetically engineered human, or artificial person. As an artificial person, he was designed and created by Dr. Jaime Hernandez, with all the upgrades and perks a parent could hope for; enhanced strength, speed and endurance, but his greatest feature is that he has the ability to psionically recreate matter, this usually takes the form of working sci-fi weapons, tools or vehicles. <br><br>

			These weapons or "props" are objects that he's seen in movies or on tv, for example, he can recreate any number of different lightsabers, phasers, bat plane, etc. All of his props are formed from radiant energy that he absorbs and then reconfigured into solid matter, but this all depend on his ability to focus and form them in his mind. The more complex and bigger the object the harder it is for him to recreate it. For instance, he can recreate Luke Skywalker's lightsaber almost instantly but the Enterprise or a Star Destroyer are currently out of his range. The biggest things that he can possible create with full concentration are the Millennium Falcon or Serenity.  <br><br>

			When he uses his power it creates a visual effect around his face where he appears to have half of a face and kirby dots bleeding off of left side.
